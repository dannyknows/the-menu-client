# Final Project Links

- [Final Deployed Website](https://the-menu-client.netlify.app/)
- [Api address](https://the-menu-api.herokuapp.com/)
- [Front End React Github](https://github.com/dannyknows/the-menu-client)
- [Back End Rails Api Github](https://github.com/cDask/the-menu-api)

# Set up

To use the web site locally some things are required to set it up properly. Including a local copy of both the client repository and the back end repository. These instructions will only work on Linux and Mac 

## 1. Set up Rails Back End

1. git clone the project from the repository [here](https://github.com/cDask/the-menu-api) in a directory of your choice.
2. Using CLI `cd` into the directory and run:
```
  bundle install
```
3. Create the database by running:

```
rails db:create
```

4. Migrate the database using:

```
rails db:migrate
```

- OPTIONAL: To get some seed data run:

```
rails db:seed
```
5. You will need to make a master key in order to get the backend to work to do this delete the `credentials.yml.enc` from the config directory.
6. Run 

```
run rails credentials:edit
```
To generate a new `master.key`

7. To run the rails server locally run:

```
rails server
```

## 2. Set up React Front End

1. git clone the front end from the repository [here](https://github.com/cDask/the-menu-api) into a directory of your choice
2. Using the command line `cd` into the directory and run:
```
 yarn install
```
To install all dependencies.

3. To get the project to function you will need to create a file and name it `.env.development`.
4. Paste the below code into the file:

```
PORT=8080
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```
 
5. To run the front end server run:

```
yarn start
```

6. This will open the project in your browser but can also be found on the address: [localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
7. If you seeded data in the steps above you can test functionality using the following credentials:

```
email: test@test.com
password: testpass
```

# Libraries

Several libraries were utilised in this project. Below is a comprehensive list of libraries used in the front end and the back end.

## Rails Back End Libraries

- jbuilder - This is the json builder to create the complex json responses from our api.
- bcrypt - Library used to encrypt data for our user authentication
- knock - User authentication library
- rspec-rails - Testing library used to do unit testing and integration testing of the back end.
- factory_bot_rails - Testing library that creates fake entries to be used for our back end testing.
- should-matchers - Testing library that gives more powerful functionality to create test cases.
- simplecov - A test coverage library that creates a back end testing report.
- database cleaner - A library that cleans up any records from the database created during testing.
- rubocop-rails - A linter to ensure that our code follow a specific format.

# Purpose

The Purpose of our app is to create a platform for small restaurant owners to establish an online presence.

With "final project name" the restaurant owner will be able to create a simple page with general information about their business to have a google page ranking.

Currently the skew of restaurant online representation is large and confusing. Some opt for just a google maps listing, having only opening hours, address and contact information. Others options are a facebook page, which offers less customisation, or a full fledges wix website which can be time consuming and confusing.

We aim to solve this problem of multiple identities, where businesses can collected all their information in one place, while linking already established identities, such as Instagram, UberEats and or Google Maps.

# Features/Functionality

The final application should have the following features

- Account registration - User should be able to sign up for a new account
- Log in functionality - Registered User should be able to log in to their accounts
- Create a restaurant web page - A user should be able to create and add a new restaurant page
- Create/Add a menu to a restaurant - Users should have the ability to add one or more menus to their restaurants
- Create/Add items to menus - Users should be able to add items to their menus
- Tag items - Items should be able to have one or several different tags such as dietary information like vegan, gluten free etc.
- Add ingredients to items - A user should be able to add ingredients to their items
- Different sizes or prices - A user should be able to have different sizes of item that can have different prices. For examples glass of wine or bottle of wine.
- Pick different themes for menus and items - Users should be able to pick different layouts/themes for their menus and items
- Pick different colours and styles for restaurant, menus and items - A user should be able to customize the colours, fonts and styles of their restaurant page, menu sections and each item in their menus.
- Add extra contact information - A user should be able to add additional information about their restaurant such as google maps link, phone number, social media or delivery service.
- Edit their webpage - Users should be able to edit their restaurant web page including themes, styles and information.
- Unique URLs - Restaurants should have unique web urls
- View their webpage - Anybody should be able to view the restaurants webpage

# Target Audience

The target audience for this project is aimed specifically at small restaurant owners who may not have their own website or web presence. This service is to give those small business owner an opportunity to have an customizable webpage to show case their restaurant.

It will also target everyday restaurants customer who are looking for more information about local smaller restaurants online and want to see their menu offerings as well as filter through their menu depending on different criteria.

# Task Management

[TRELLO LINK](https://trello.com/b/ltlnpgUl/t3a2-final-project)

To organise and manage task we will be using Trello. Trello will allow us to track the task which each team members are working on as well as track the task status. The way our task workflow would work is, a new task will first be created in the to do list at which point it will be labelled by the different labels explained here:

- Code - This specify a task required coding
- Structure - This task involved adding or structuring the code or project, often involving command lines.
- Design - This task involves anything to do with aesthetics of the project
- Project Management - A PM task often involves documentation or the management of the project
- Bug - This specifies a task that involved fixing a problem or error
- Testing - This task involves creating tests.

We will also assign a due date and any other relevant information to each card. When we start working on a task we will assign ourselves to the task and move it to the doing list. Once a task is completed if it is a code task we move it to the testing list to go through testing. After the task has been tested or if its a non-code task a task will be moved to review where the task will be reviewed by another team member before being moved to Done. Review is also where any code refactoring will be done. Tasks can be moved back and forth between the list depending on if more work needs to be done on them or if tests fails. The following screenshots are screenshots of the Trello board for each day since the project start.

## Phase B - Development Journal

We used the same task management style and system for our trello outlined above with some new labels:
- Ruby on Rails Back End - This label is assigned to any task that involves the Ruby on Rails Back End code
- React Front End - This label is assigned to any task that involves the React Front End code
- View - This label is assigned to anything that involves the view of the project

Our development process was very similar to what was outlined above with us discussing briefly what we were currently working on and assigning ourselves to those tasks. Any task could still be moved back and forth between list depending if more work had to be done. Any task in review that did not involve both team members would be moved to done by other team member once reviewed. Similarly any pull request made during the project would only be merged by the other team member after inspection. Below is a trello screenshot of every day of development with a short statement stating what was done by each team member.
